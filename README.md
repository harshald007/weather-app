## Project Overview:

1) **Real-time Weather Data:** Get the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city.
2) **7-Day Forecast**: Displays a detailed weather forecast for the upcoming week.
3) **City Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather updates by entering the city name.
4) **Data Visualization**: Visual elements like charts/graphs to display temperature trends over time.
5) **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views for a seamless experience across devices.
6) **User-Friendly UI**: Material-UI components enhance the user experience with a clean and minimalistic design.
7) **Optional Features**(can be added based on future development needs):

## Technologies Used:
   - **React.js**: Frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
   - **Material-UI**: UI library for responsive and aesthetically pleasing components.
   - **OpenWeatherMap API**: Third-party API for fetching weather data.
   - **Chart.js** (or any other graphing library): For visualizing data trends.

## How to Run:
1) Clone the repository: git clone <repo-link>
2) Install dependencies: npm install
3) Get your API key from OpenWeatherMap and add it to the .env file.

## Future Enhancements:

# Getting Started with  React App weather


## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
